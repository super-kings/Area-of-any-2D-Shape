We need to implement the same thing using OOP concept.
Make this program able to calculate outer, inner surface area and volume of 3d shapes.
Also 2d shape perimeter.
And many more.......
Make an app that has GUI.
This gives us a list of operations that can be performed.
These operations are buttons.
After clicking a button, we need to give input in a text field and hit GO.
Then calculation happens and returns the answer.
That's it.
